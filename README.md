# Stanford Compression Library
The goal of the library is to help with research in the area of data compression. This is not meant to be fast or efficient implementation, but rather for educational purpose


## Compression algorithms
Here is a list of algorithms implemented.
- [Huffman codes](compressors/huffman_coder.py)
- [Shannon codes](compressors/shannon_coder.py)
- [Fano codes](compressors/fano_coder.py)
- [Shannon Fano Elias](compressors/shannon_fano_elias_coder.py)
- [Golomb codes](compressors/golomb_coder.py)
- [Universal integer coder](compressors/universal_integer_coder.py)
- [rANS](compressors/rANS.py)
- [tANS](compressors/tANS.py)
- [zlib(external)](external_compressors/zlib_external.py)


NOTE -> the tests in each file should be helpful as a "usage" example of each of the compressors. More details are also available on the wiki page.
