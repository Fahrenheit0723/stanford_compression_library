# Stanford Compression Library
The goal of the library is to help with research in the area of data compression. This is not meant to be fast or efficient implementation, but rather for educational purpose

## Getting started
- Create a virtualenv [TODO] (tested with python ver:`3.8.2`)
- Install required packages [TODO]
